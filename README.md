# JavaScript Variables

![Screenshot of the finished webpage](assets//complete.png)

## Description üìÑ

In this project, you'll dive into key JavaScript concepts, focusing on the differences between `let` and `const` and how to use them effectively. You'll see how `let` allows you to reassign values while `const` keeps them fixed, and practice making console outputs clearer and more readable. Through hands-on examples, you'll manipulate variables, use them in expressions, and combine them to create dynamic content. By the end, you'll know when to choose `let` or `const` and how to use them confidently in your code.

# Instructions ‚úÖ

## 1. **Create the Project Folder and Files**

- [ ] Create a folder named `JavaScriptVariables` to store all your project files.
- [ ] Inside the `JavaScriptVariables` folder, create a file named `index.js`. This will be your main JavaScript file.

## 2. **Set Up JavaScript Variables**

Variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `let` or `const`.

- [ ] Open your `index.js` file and add the following code:

```js
// Using let to declare a variable
let age = 25; 
console.log(age); // Expected Output: 25

// Using const to declare a variable
const birthYear = 1998;
console.log(birthYear); // Expected Output: 1998
```

- [ ] See your code in action: Run the JavaScript file in your terminal by entering the command `node index.js` and pressing Enter.

**Explanation:**
- `let` is used for variables that can be reassigned and allows us to change the value later if needed.
- `const` declares a constant value, meaning it cannot be reassigned.

## 3. **Make Your Console Logs More Readable**

By default, `console.log()` outputs the variable value alone. To make the output more readable, you can use strings to provide context.
- [ ] Update your `console.log()` 

```js
console.log("Initial Age:", age); // Expected Output: Initial Age: 25
console.log("Birth Year:", birthYear); // Expected Output: Birth Year: 1998
```

**Explanation:**
- The first `console.log()` simply prints the value of `name`.
- The second `console.log()` uses a string and a variable to provide a clearer message in the console.

## 4. **Building On Previous Examples: Demonstrate Variable Mutability**

### Example 3:

Let's modify the `age` variable declared with `let` and observe the behavior of `const`:

```js
// Modify the age variable
age = 30; 
console.log("Updated Age: ", age); // Expected Output: Updated Age: 30

// Attempt to modify the const variable birthYear
// Uncommenting the next line will cause an error
// birthYear = 2000; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
console.log("Birth Year: ", birthYear); // Expected Output: Birth Year: 1998
```

**Explanation:**
- `age` is declared with `let`, so we can change its value later. 
- `birthYear` is declared with `const`, so any attempt to change its value will result in an error.

## 5. **Using Variables in Expressions**

You can also use variables in mathematical expressions:

### Example 4:

```js
let currentYear = 2024;
let yearsSinceBirth = currentYear - birthYear;
console.log("Years Since Birth: ", yearsSinceBirth); // Expected Output: 26

// Update the current year
currentYear = 2025;
yearsSinceBirth = currentYear - birthYear;
console.log("Years Since Birth After Update: ", yearsSinceBirth); // Expected Output: 27
```

**Explanation:**
- This example shows how `let` allows for reassigning new values and using them in expressions.
- When `currentYear` is updated, the calculation automatically reflects the change.

## 6. **Combining String Variables and Constants**

You can combine string variables and constants to create sentences:

### Example 5:

```js
const greeting = "Hello";
let userName = "Alice";
let personalizedGreeting = greeting + ", " + userName + "!";
console.log(personalizedGreeting); // Expected Output: Hello, Alice!

// Changing userName
userName = "Bob";
personalizedGreeting = greeting + ", " + userName + "!";
console.log("Updated Greeting: ", personalizedGreeting); // Expected Output: Hello, Bob!
```

**Explanation:**
- `const greeting` is not changed, while `let userName` can be reassigned.
- The output shows how we can construct a dynamic greeting message.

## 7. **Test and Run Your JavaScript Code**

- [ ] Open your `index.js` file in a browser's developer tools console or a JavaScript environment and see the output.

## Conclusion üìÑ

Congratulations! You've learned how to use `let` and `const` in JavaScript, observed how they behave differently, and practiced using variables in expressions and concatenations to make your code more dynamic and readable.
